# Codewire

> Persistent process server for AI coding agents. Manages long-running PTY sessions
> that survive disconnects. Use it to launch agents, detach, and reconnect later.
> Sessions keep running even after your process exits — like tmux but built for
> programmatic control.
>
> Also an MCP server: `claude mcp add --scope user codewire -- cw mcp-server`
